# Unity-Timeline-Video-Project
A video project using Unity Timeline, with HDRP, was made to explain The Fresnel effect for my YouTube channel. 
You can use this project as a reference to learn how I have used Timeline to animate and make a full-length video. The video produced from this project has already been published on my Youtube channel.

This project uses the water simulation in HDRP. Refer: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/WaterScenes 
This project uses the Ryatracing technique, so you need a good PC spec to run smoothly.
